We implement a class Rational, which will allow us to do elementary exact calculations on rational numbers.

Our implementation will be similiar to the one in [Ulrich Breymann - Der C++ Programmierer - 4. Auflage].

A rational number will be represented as to numbers of type long, the numerator and the denominator. Negative numbers
will have a negative numerator and a positive denominator. Fractions will be cancelled after each operation.

The class will include the following member functions:
.getNumerator()
.getDenominator()
.setR(long numerator,long denominator)
.inputR()
.ourputR()
.reciprocal()
.add(Rational)
.sub(Rational)
.mult(Rational)
.div(Rational)
.cancel()

Furthermore there will be the following functions:
add(Rational, Rational)
sub(Rational, Rational)
mult(Rational, Rational)
div(Rational, Rational)
